LIGHTS OUT AND THE RACE STARTED!

I finished the development of this game in 1.5 hours to measure the reflexes of the racing pilot in everyone. (Game assets are taken free of charge from the internet and are not used commercially)

The gameplay of the game is quite simple, when the lights turn out, the person who presses the button fastest takes off and wins. However, if you press early, your car breaks down and your opponent takes off while the pit crew repairs it. This game, where you can both race against the AI and measure your time or compete with your friends, calls out to the racing pilot in you.
